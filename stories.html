                            <p>We're gathering stories from local people in Bethnal Green who support the safer streets and are against reopening the roads. Like many residents, we hear how they have come to like the new seating areas and parks, and appreciate the areas that are quieter and safer for all. These are locals who want to see further improvements, not a return to busy roads and pollution.</p>

                            <p>We thank all for their enthusiasm and for joining our campaign.</p>

Now we have this pedestrian area, everyone can access the park easily. I think, what’s the point of green space if it’s surrounded by traffic? Spaces like this are so important when we haven’t got our own gardens."</blockquote>
                            <p>This isn't a good situation: more cars, even more people, and all in the same space. What's clear is we need to discourage driving and we have to put more thought put into designing streets where people can walk, talk and play safely.</p>

                            <p>The nursery nurse and mother-of-one was "heartbroken" when she heard that her favourite seating spot on Old Bethnal Green Road might be taken away.</p>
                            <p>She says her neighbours in the building just behind the communal area are equally upset.</p>                          
                            <blockquote>"Why do they want to remove this? They only put it in a year ago. I was so shocked when I heard about the plans."</blockquote>
                            <p>She says her neighbours in the building just behind the communal area are equally upset.</p>
                            <blockquote>"A lot of older people come out and sit here. When I explained the situation to them, they said 'No! They can’t take this from us, it’s not right! It’s the only place we have to go when the weather is good.' That touches my heart, because they are like my grandmas, you know?"</blockquote>
                            <p>Saciido moved to the area from Shoreditch seven years ago with her son, who is now at university and likes to play basketball on Middleton Green.</p>
                            <blockquote>"We don’t have our own gardens. I come down here, I use my phone, I watch my son playing in the park. Sometimes the children come over here playing. I watch them and I say, 'Thank you God, at least we have this space.'<br>"And now someone wants to come here and use it for cars and parking."</blockquote>
                            <p>Saciido says that Old Bethnal Green Road was 'horrible' before the changes.</p>
                            <blockquote>"There were a lot of cars here, it was noisy and dangerous for vulnerable people. Look at it now! I want to keep it like this. It’s precious, like a diamond."</blockquote>
                            <p>What she really wants to see is people working together.</p>
                            <blockquote>"We love our area, the good and the bad. Tower Hamlets is a nice borough. If we talk, listen, work together, we can improve things for our children. I’d tell the mayor, improve things, don’t destroy them! Don’t take this place away, leave it alone!"</blockquote>

                                It's great to walk along there and see other families on the way to school, it feels a lot safer without the morning rush of cars. </blockquote>

                            <blockquote>"I think we need to calm down a little and talk this through... We have to find a middle ground and work together. Just as we're getting used to the new street, they want to change it back, but they need to talk to us properly
                                first. It affects our daily lives, not theirs!</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>“What we need to do now is move forward as a community.”</blockquote>
