									We at Save our Safer Streets are challenging Tower Hamlet's new mayor and
									council to publish local data on emergency service response times, air quality
									and traffic congestion.
								</b>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								<b
									>Not just waiting for the council, we're building an evidence base that shows
									the new street designs across the borough haven’t had the negative impacts the
									Mayor and others have claimed, and that their removal isn’t justified.
								</b>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large"><b>So far, our key findings show:</b></p>
							<ul class="w3-large">
								<li>
									<b>NO increase in ambulance response times</b> attributable to the Low Traffic
									Neighbourhood (LTN) schemes in Bethnal Green, and some neighbourhoods within
									Bethnal Green’s LTN areas seeing improvements in response times.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>No increase in fire service response times</b> since the installation of the
									LTNs and other new road layouts. This is for all five wards in Tower Hamlets
									where LTNs have been installed.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>NO increase in journey times on boundary roads</b> attributable to the LTNs -
									journey times have increased on all roads at a similar rate. Eastbound journeys
									on Hackney Road have increased by 30 seconds at most, but this is likely to be
									for several reasons such as roadworks and LTNs in neighbouring Hackney.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Air quality is now dramatically better than it was in 2019</b>, across all of
									Tower Hamlets, and the LTNs are not going to change this trend.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Tower Hamlets Council will make a decision on 28 September about whether to
								“re-open the roads”, based on the result of a public consultation. The
								consultation document included several statements about the new layouts,
								including claims of significant delays to emergency service vehicles, increased
								congestion, significant bus delays, higher levels of pollution and worsening air
								quality.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								When the consultation launched, we were concerned that it didn’t mention any of
								the benefits of the street schemes, and didn’t provide evidence of any negative
								impacts. We began our own research using Freedom of Information requests (FoIs)
								and data already in the public domain.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Through our FoI requests we have gathered data from organisations including
								London Fire Brigade, London Ambulance Service, Transport for London and Hackney
								Council. Unfortunately Tower Hamlets Council has not yet responded, despite
								repeated requests and missed deadlines.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Today we are challenging the council to publish data that backs up its
								consultation statements. The evidence we’ve compiled suggests those statements
								are inaccurate, and they shouldn’t be used to justify the full re-opening of all
								roads in Tower Hamlets.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">Our research has found:</p>

					<div class="w3-row">
						<div class="w3-container w3-text-black" id="emergency">
							<h2><b>Emergency service response times</b></h2>
							<p class="w3-large">
								The mayor’s consultation claimed without evidence that there have been “numerous
								reported incidents where emergency service responses have been hindered by
								physical road closures.”
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								The mayor’s consultation claimed without evidence that there have been “numerous
								reported incidents where emergency service responses have been hindered by
								physical road closures.” We’ve found this isn’t the case. Analysis of the
								Emergency Service response times for the first set of road closures to go in, in
								Bethnal Green, has shown there has been no overall increase in emergency
								response times for either London Fire Brigade or the London Ambulance Service
								when compared to other areas of Tower Hamlets.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								For ambulance response times, the data shows <b>no measurable worsening</b> that
								can be attributed to the LTN. For Category 1 response times (the highest
								category of emergencies) there are no significant differences before and after
								the LTNs were put in place. And, in fact, although Category 2 (less critical)
								ambulance response times in Tower Hamlets and reportedly across the UK have
								become slower since December 2020, the slow downs have been LESS in the areas
								surrounding Bethnal Green’s LTNs.
								<b>This suggests the LTNs might actually be helping ambulances.</b>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Our data from the fire services is much more comprehensive. We’ve analysed data
								for response times across all of Tower Hamlets and focused in particular for the
								five wards with new road layouts: Bow West, Spitalfields and Banglatown, St
								Katherine's and Wapping, St Peter's and Weavers. [option 1:] In all but one
								ward, average response times have fallen since the new road layouts. In St
								Peter’s there has been just a one second increase in average response times.
								This, however, is not statistically significant. In all cases, having run
								statistical tests, we can say average response times for the Fire Services have
								stayed stable. [option 2:] Having run statistical tests, we’ve discovered in all
								wars <b>average response times for the Fire Services have stayed stable</b>. In
								other words, the LTNs have had no difference to fire engine response times.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								The data on fire service response times shows that for Tower Hamlets overall,
								and for the E2 postcode, Weavers and St Peter’s wards, there is very little
								change in response times before and after the LTN schemes were put in place (Jan
								2019 – May 2021). The biggest delay recorded was in St Peter’s ward of just 15
								seconds, and several areas actually showed improved response times.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								<b
									>The claim that there have been numerous reported incidents is not backed up by
									the data either.</b
								>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Out of the 14,756 Cat 1 and 2 (life-threatening / emergency) ambulance calls
								that have been made to the postcodes covered by the Bethnal Green LTN since
								2019, only nine have had delays attributed in any way to the Liveable Streets
								scheme – <b>0.06% of all calls</b>.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								While any delay is less than ideal, this information shows it is a small problem
								with less than 6 in 10,000 calls experiencing any kind of recorded delay that
								can be attributed to the LTNs. There is also no evidence that these delays are
								an ongoing problem to the London Ambulance Service as they have not identified
								the cause of any delays.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								We know that in the early days of the LTNs, there were some issues around parts
								of the scheme as well as problems with ambulance crews not knowing the new
								layout. Tower Hamlets council amended the scheme soon after it was put in, in
								response to feedback from the emergency services. Further evidence would be
								needed to support claims that delays have persisted.

							<h2>
								<b>Traffic and congestion</b>
							</h2>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Another claim in the consultation document is that “congestion on Hackney Road
								and Bethnal Green Road (has) increased.” Congestion is best and most easily
								measured using TFL bus journey times. Our analysis of bus journey times and
								other data provided by TFL shows that on almost all boundary roads near the
								LTNS, changes in journey times are in line with the general trend on similar
								roads (without LTNs) in Tower Hamlets.

							<p class="w3-large">

								analysis of bus journey times and other data provided by TFL shows that on
								almost all boundary roads near the LTNS, changes in journey times are in line
								with the general trend on similar roads (without LTNs) in Tower Hamlets.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								There has been slight slowing in the Eastbound stretch of Hackney Road, but the
								data shows that
								<b>at most bus journey times have increased by an average of 30 seconds.</b>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								This road receives a lot of traffic from bordering Hackney, which has also
								brought in changes to traffic management in recent years. It is not possible or
								credible to attribute the slight slowing of traffic to the Tower Hamlets LTN.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Hackney Road and Bethnal Green Road have always been two of the slower roads in
								the borough for bus journeys. Since the LTNs were installed,
								<b
									>Hackney Road eastbound has slowed by less than 1mph and Bethnal Green Road has
									seen no change</b
								>
								– while Whitechapel Road, far from the LTN zone, has become slower than either
								of them.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Another trend is that
								<b>journey times, having slowed in 2021 / 22, are now improving again</b>. This
								may indicate that things are settling down after the introduction of the LTNs
								and motorists are adapting. At the very least, it shows that the picture is more
								nuanced than this particular LTN = busier boundary roads.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Traffic patterns in Tower Hamlets have shifted around a great deal in the last
								couple of years for many reasons. Besides the installations of LTNs in Tower
								Hamlets we have seen several lockdowns, new ULEZ rules, and more cars on the
								roads across the borough than in 2019.
								<b
									>None of the evidence we have seen supports the claim that congestion has
									increased enough to justify reversing the LTNs – especially when you look at air
									quality.</b
								>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								<b
									>A letter released to us through an FOI request to TFL also points out that
									reversing the changes on the Old Bethnal Green Road scheme, will potentially
									also have an impact on bus journey times and congestion on Hackney Road. In an
									official letter to Lutfur Rahman, dated 28 July this year, Will Norman from TFL
									stated:</b
								>
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“...Removing the Old Bethnal Road scheme would prevent TfL introducing a bus
								priority scheme on Hackney Road as cyclists who currently benefit from the
								scheme would be forced back to use that road.”

								<b>Air quality</b>
							</h2>
							<p class="w3-large">
								The bottom line on air quality in Tower Hamlets is that it is
								<b>dramatically better now that it was a few years ago</b> – according to the
								council’s own data.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								<b>Everywhere in the borough now has lower pollution levels than in 2019</b> and
								is within air quality objectives. Only Roman Road / Globe Road and Whitechapel
								High St have seen any increase in pollution since 2020, and both are still far
								below 2019 levels.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								It’s too early for accurate data for 2022, but up until the end of 2021 there
								was <b>no negative impact on air quality on boundary roads</b> from the Old

								<b>Conclusion</b>
							</h2>
							<p class="w3-large">
								<b
									>In the absence of evidence that the changes to road layouts have had negative
									impacts on emergency service response times, congestion and air quality, the
									question of whether to reverse the new road layouts becomes a matter of personal
									preference and personal convenience for motorists. This needs to be weighed
									carefully against improved safety, the needs of the whole community and the
									wider climate crisis.</b
								>
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large">
								<b
									>It always takes time to get used to change. There may be improvements that can
									be made to the street schemes which address residents’ concerns, but ripping out
									the entire scheme without evidence that it’s not working would be hugel wasteful
									and unnecessarily extreme.</b
