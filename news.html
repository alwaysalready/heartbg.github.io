								400+ support the report findings and sign open letter to Tower Hamlets mayor and
								council.
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Since we came together as a group last summer, one of our biggest concerns has been
								about the way the Liveable Streets consultations have been run by Tower Hamlets Council
								- both the recent one in February and the one conducted last summer.
							</p>
							<p>
								This week, we sent a report to the Tower Hamlets mayor, his cabinet and senior officers,
								laying out the problems we have found with how the recent Liveable Streets consultations
								were run.
							</p>
							<p>
								The report was accompanied by an open letter summarising our findings, which was
								co-signed by the London Cycling Campaign, Oaklands School, Tower Hamlets Wheelers and
								over 400 locals.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our report lays out how the conduct of the council has fallen short of the Aspire
								manifesto pledges at every stage since the May 2022 elections. We explain how their
								consultation process prevents them from fairly canvassing all views:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Key stakeholders</strong> - Residents and interested parties such as
									schools, TfL, Bart’s
									Health Trust and the Met Police, have objected to the mayor’s proposals and have not
									been listened to.</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Multiple consultations</strong> - Re-consulting with the same proposal
									undermines trust in
									the democratic process.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Bias and confusion</strong> - Information presented to the public has been
									extremely
									one-sided, downplaying the benefits of the current layouts and exaggerating the
									benefits of “reopening the roads”. The second consultation overloaded people with
									confusing graphs, unreadable plans and the consultation period was so short that it
									left insufficient time to ensure clarifications could be sought.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Process</strong> - Many people have been excluded from the process due to
									the lack of
									warning, in-person events and confusing documents. The way that ‘unique survey
									reference numbers’ have been relied on by the council means that hundreds of local
									voices have been discounted from the headline presentation of survey results.

								SOSS campaign discovers hundreds of local residents’ views were excluded from LBTH
								Council’s consultation report
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Today we issued a <a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/missing-votes">press release and
									data
									sheet</a> that show Tower Hamlets Council didn't include hundreds of local
								residents’ responses in its analysis of last summer’s Liveable Streets consultation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Removing these responses significantly changed the outcome of last year’s survey,
								which
								was only revealed when the council launched the second consultation in January.
							</p>
							<p>
								The information we have now received in response to an FOI request shows that over
								400
								resident responses in the Bethnal Green area and over 200 residents’ responses in
								the
								Weavers area were excluded from the data the council published as “local responses”.
								This meant that up to 28% of local residents’ views were disregarded in the
								council’s
								analysis for some areas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The responses were excluded because they didn’t use the code from the paper
								consultation
								packs, even though their postcodes should have been enough to identify them as
								‘local’.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our analysis shows that when these residents’ responses are included, the results
								reveal
								significantly stronger support for keeping the current street layouts.

								"Tower Hamlets Council 'misrepresented' TfL on Liveable Streets"
							</h4>
							<p class="w3-medium">
								Roman Road LDN has published
								<a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/tower-hamlets-council-misrepresent-tfl-position-liveable-streets-ltns/"
									target="_blank">a piece</a> which reveals that Transport for London believes it was
								'misrepresented' in Tower Hamlets Council's latest round of public consultations about
								Liveable Streets.
							</p>
							<p>
								This has recently come to light through a Freedom of Information request in which TfL
								Strategy Officer Alex Williams writes, in a letter to Tower Hamlets Council:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“[W]e firmly support retention of the LTN on Old Bethnal Green Road. We have offered
								funding and resources to progress further bus priority measures on Hackney Road, to
								address any impacts caused by the LTN."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								By contrast, the council claimed that TfL supported removal of the LTNs, claiming delays
								to busses on Hackney Road. Campaigners are concerned that this could have imapcted the
								consultation results.

							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Dear Mayor Rahman,</p>

								<p>
									We the undersigned are all headteachers of the schools located within the Old
									Bethnal Green Road and Weavers “Liveable Streets” schemes and we would therefore
									be severely impacted by the proposals the council published on 19 January.
								</p>

								<p>
									We have experienced Bethnal Green before the new street layouts and after. And
									it is clear to all of us that the recent changes to our local streets have
									brought about significant improvements to the safety and health around our
									schools.
								</p>

								<p>
									Before, the immediate area around our schools was dominated by speeding
									vehicles, noise and fumes.  Now, we can see from the data provided that there
									has been a significant reduction in cars using the roads around our schools and
									that this has positively affected air quality.
								</p>

								<p>
									From the summer 2022 consultation results that you have recently published, we
									can see that support for the changes is a majority view in Bethnal Green and
									Tower Hamlets as a whole.
								</p>

								<p>
									Are the current schemes perfect? Surely not. Can they be improved? Yes, we think
									so.
								</p>

								<p>
									Ofsted requires us to identify and mitigate threats to children’s health and
									safety and the proposals are a threat to safe arrival and departure from school.
									Ofsted also requires us to communicate with stakeholders and this is why we are
									speaking out to make our position on this issue clear.
								</p>

								<p>
									That is why we are deeply concerned by the proposals you have published at the
									start of a three-week consultation process. You haven’t put forward any options
									for improving the schemes by building on what we currently have. Instead, you
									are presenting a choice between reopening roads such as Old Bethnal Green Road
									to more than 6,000 vehicles per day or keeping the layouts as they are.
								</p>

								<p>
									You are furthermore confusing matters by saying that schools such as ours will
									only be able to benefit from improved pedestrian crossings if the current street
									layouts are removed. Why should we have to choose between a safe, low-traffic
									area for our students and a zebra crossing outside our school? Controlled
									crossings in sensible places would significantly improve the current layouts,
									without the need to re-introduce thousands of dangerous and polluting vehicles
									every day around our schools.
								</p>

								<p>
									Please reconsider your proposal and work with us and other stakeholders and the
									wider community on a third option, which accepts that the current layouts are

								We urge residents to “see through council’s greenwash” and
								<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/liveablestreets?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Orlo"
									target="_blank">vote to keep the current street layouts</a>.
							</h4>
							<p>
								We at Save Our Safer Streets are shocked and disappointed at a
								<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/liveablestreets?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Orlo"
									target="_blank">consultation launched by Tower Hamlets Council</a>
								(19 Jan ‘23) on the future of Liveable Streets schemes - six months after a
								previous consultation on the same proposals.
							</p>

							<p>
								The results of the last consultation, which have not been published until now,
								show wide-ranging support for the current street layouts.
							</p>

							<p>
								We urge residents who support the low traffic schemes to see through the flawed
								and very misleading text in the new documents and vote for
								<strong>Option 2</strong> - to keep the new layouts. Option 1, to remove the
								schemes, amounts to blatant greenwashing.
							</p>

							<p>
								It's good that the new consultation document contains evidence which was missing
								in the last one, but it also contains many baseless claims. For example, it
								claims that ripping out both dedicated cycle lanes and quieter, traffic-free
								social spaces will encourage people to walk, cycle and socialise, as long as the
								council also puts in a few plants and a handful of new crossings and three
								dropped kerbs. This is nonsense. Who will cycle or walk more or sit on a
								solitary bench with 6,000 more cars thundering along Old Bethnal Green Rd?
							</p>

							<p>
								We're pleased the council have included some of the clear evidence that the
								schemes are working. Their data shows that the new layouts have improved our
								neighbourhoods, reducing traffic across the area by 9,700 vehicles a day and
								introducing better, safer, walking and cycling routes. Residents living near the
								schemes supported all the current measures except one. Across the borough,
								support for the schemes was overwhelming.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite this positive data and clear local support, the Mayor and council are
								choosing to ignore the first consultation and the
								<a href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=184&RPID=58550332&HPID=58550332"
									target="_blank">second biggest petition ever in the borough</a>. They are trying
								yet
								again to push their same old idea - one that will cost
								millions of pounds.
							</p>

							<p>
								The council’s suggested changes will have a wide impact, putting at risk
								much-needed improvements to Hackney Road including a proposed new bus lane which
								Transport for London have said can only be put in if the current street layouts
								remain.
							</p>

							<p>
								So far the Mayor has ignored our repeated requests to work together respectfully
								to find ways to keep what is successful in the area and build on that. We
								believe the best solution is to listen to local people, keep the current layouts
								and make smaller, cost-effective changes if necessary.
							</p>

							<p>
								Again, we urge the people of Bethnal Green to look beyond the false claims from
								the council and not be overwhelmed by the details in the 20-page document. As
								residents we need to show we still care about our streets being healthier,
								friendlier and safer for children, disabled and older people and all of us.
								<a href="https://talk.towerhamlets.gov.uk/liveablestreets?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Orlo"
									target="_blank">Choose Option 2 – to keep the schemes</a>. This is the only way
								to
								avoid wasting a lot of money and taking our
								neighbourhood back to the noisy, unhealthy and unfriendly past.

								We’re so proud of what we achieved in the meeting but very disappointed by the
								stonewalling and extremely partisan political behaviour from Aspire party
								councillors.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Our petition asked the council not to rush ahead with its plan to “reopen the
								roads”, but listen to community voices, experts and data before making decisions
								more likely to “please almost everyone”.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">

							<img src="media/oaklands_students_TH_council_meeting.jpg"
								class="w3-image w3-margin-bottom w3-round lazy"
								alt="Image from Roman Road London webpage." />

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Inside, speakers for the petition, acting on our behalf, were Simon Ramsay,
								headteacher of Oaklands School in Bethnal Green, Jane Harris, a carer for her
								disabled husband, and Shaheena Parvin, a mother of five and Aspire voter, who
								spoke movingly of the way the new street layouts have transformed life for her
								family – especially her four-year-old autistic son.
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">After the meeting, Jane Harris said:</p>
							<blockquote>
								“I was so proud of the three of us this evening – and of the 50 supporters who
								came all the way to the Town Hall on a rainy weeknight to show how much they
								want safer, healthier, friendlier streets. We had taxi drivers, school children,
								a real mix of ages and ethnicities, staging a peaceful and colourful
								demonstration.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“Our group has worked hard for months to show the council how people really feel
								about the street schemes. We’ve met with councillors, sent them an 900-signature
								open letter, submitted one of the borough's biggest ever petitions and a range
								of stories about the benefits of the schemes for a diverse range of residents.
								We’ve drawn their attention to letters from schools, Barts Health and TfL. We’ve
								even published our own data analysis, assembled through FoI requests. They also
								have the results of their own consultation, which they haven’t shared.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“We hoped that ‘the mayor who listens’ would take all this evidence on board and
								actually engage with us, instead of just talking about listening. This was a
								great opportunity for him to alter his approach.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“It was extremely disappointing, to have our efforts belittled and dismissed by
								Aspire councillors who seemed not to have heard anything we have been saying.
								Their response to us all along has amounted to stonewalling. They are still
								choosing to repeat unfounded claims about issues with the schemes and never
								mentioning the real benefits. We’re still none the wiser about timelines or
								decisions about our streets.”
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Jane said that a minority of councillors did show willingness to engage.
							</p>

							<blockquote>
								“We were really pleased that Councillor Asma Islam for Labour tabled a motion
								which supported many of our asks,” she said. “She said this shouldn’t be a party
								political issue. But Councillor Kabir Ahmed’s speech, for Aspire, was more
								focused on scoring political points than addressing the valid concerns of
								thousands of his constituents. He belittled and dismissed us. This was extremely
								partisan political behaviour.
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								“We came away shocked by his lack of any respect for the 3,094 people who have
								signed our petition. Why is Aspire so stuck in the past, instead of working to
								improve things now and for the future?”
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								We heard later in the meeting, Mayor Rahman announce that he would be keeping
								the Wapping bus gate, citing “<a
									href="https://twitter.com/LutfurRahmanTH/status/1577742488655241217"
									target="_blank">evidence and responses to public opinion surveys.</a>”
							</p>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">Responding to this, Jane continued:</p>

							<blockquote>
								“We are pleased about the bus gate, but we’re incredulous to hear that he based
								his decision on evidence and consultation results when he still hasn’t published
								any. This doesn’t feel like a listening approach to us.
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								“There's a long way to go. We’ll know the mayor is really listening when he and
								his councillors respond to our campaign asks and acknowledge what so many people
								keep trying to tell them – that these schemes have massive benefits.”
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
								Unsatisfied by the council’s response, we are considering our options for next
								steps, including a possible <a href="legal-challenge.html">legal challenge</a>.

									<b>There has been

								<li>
									<b>There has been
										<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/ambulance">NO increase in ambulance response

								<li>
									<b>There has been
										<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/boundary">NO increase in journey times on

											roads attributable to the LTNs</a></b>
									- journey times have increased on all roads at a similar rate. Eastbound

								<li>

								Responding to Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman’s
								<a href="https://twitter.com/LutfurRahmanTH/status/1575178336640241664">statement</a>
								at the cabinet meeting on 28 September, Simon Ramsay, headteacher of Oaklands
								School on Old Bethnal Green Road, said:
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“There was some positive new information in the Mayor’s announcement, such as a
									commitment to ‘grasp all the issues affecting our residents on both sides of the
									debate’. However, we are disappointed to hear him repeat many unproven claims
									about the impacts of the new street layouts. It’s frustrating that he didn’t
									share the results of the recent consultation either, six weeks after it
									finished.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“Our petition, signed by over 3,000 locals, asked him to take the time to
									listen. He says that he will, and we hope this means he will truly take all
									views on board.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“If he were to listen, he would hear from many people right across the community
									whose lives are made better by the new streets,
									<a href="https://heartbg.uk/stories.html" target="_blank">as we have</a>. He
									would hear, as our own painstaking research shows, that air quality is now
									better across all of Tower Hamlets than it was in 2019 and that the changes
									haven’t had a significant impact on traffic on boundary roads.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“If he were to listen, he would note the
									<a href="https://foi.tfl.gov.uk/FOI-1142-2223/LR%20Tower%20Hamlets%2028072022_Redacted.pdf"
										target="_blank">letter he received from TfL</a>
									which said that if he ripped out the Old Bethnal Green Road design, this ‘...
									would prevent TfL introducing a bus priority scheme on Hackney Road as cyclists
									who currently benefit from the scheme would be forced back to use that road.’
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“We were glad to hear the mayor talk about his commitment to net zero emissions
									and to working with the community to encourage people to move away from car use
									towards public transport and active travel. We strongly support these aims, but
									we’re baffled that he thinks they could be compatible with removing the street
									improvements that help people to walk and cycle.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“The mayor says he will provide updates on this issue ‘in due course’. A good
									opportunity would be 5 October, when the council will debate the
									<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/petition" target="_blank">petition</a> I submitted
									to ‘Save our safer streets in Tower Hamlets’.
								</p>
								<p class="w3-medium w3-text-black">
									“We will be asking the council to publish evidence about the impact of street
									layout changes and release the results of the consultation, two months on from
									its closure. We are calling on them to allow time for a thorough process that
									looks at any specific issues that need to be addressed, with specific solutions,
									before reaching any decision.”

								Our petition has closed today with an amazing 3,094 signatures, making it the
								second most-signed petition in Tower Hamlets ever! We saw people from across the
								community come together to ask the council to <b>STOP</b>, <b>LISTEN</b> and
								<b>IMPROVE</b>, instead of scrapping our safer, friendlier, healthier streets.

								This fantastic show of support smashes the council’s threshold of 2,000

								We owe this great campaign milestone to everybody who signed the petition and

								heard about the council’s plans and got the chance to raise their voice.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">THANK YOU EVERYONE!</p>

								We hope the debate might lead to a process of listening and collaboration

								Today we can say with some confidence that
								<b>Save Our Safer Streets is having an impact on Tower Hamlets council</b>.
							</p>
							<p>
								In August, the council approved its strategic plan, which said that it would
								decide to “reopen the roads” in September and then rush to implement that
								decision in October. The council was publicly committed to rushing through its
								proposals.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Today we know that their decision on “reopening the roads” is NOT going to be
									pushed through in September.</b>
								It is on the agenda for the 28 September 2022 cabinet meeting as an
								announcement, which means that no decision is going to be made.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>OUR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER BEAR FRUIT</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Our <em>Save Our Safer Streets</em> activities in August and September have
								contributed to this change of heart by the council:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A whole cross-section of Tower Hamlets residents have written to the mayor and
									his councillors, gone along to surgeries and shared their stories online, using
									their voices to show all the different ways that the new street layouts have
									benefitted them and their families.
								</li>
								<li>
									2,600+ people who live, work or study in Tower Hamlets have signed the petition
									started by Simon Ramsay, headteacher at Oaklands School on Old Bethnal Green
									Road, calling on the council to stop, listen and improve the new street layouts
									rather than rush to remove them. This is the highest petition currently on the
									Tower Hamlets website and the second highest in its history!
								</li>
								<li>
									And more than 220 people have donated over £16,000 to the CrowdJustice campaign,
									which is funding a potential legal challenge to the flawed process the council
									is currently pursuing.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>WHAT DOES THIS DELAY MEAN?</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								This delay to the council’s plan is a meaningful win for our campaign – in fact
								you could say that we are a step closer to achieving step 1 of our petition:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								1. We
								<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/petition" target="_blank">petition the council to STOP
									plans to scrap the new street layouts</a>
								so there is time to reach a justified decision.
							</blockquote>

							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>SO WHAT’S NEXT?</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								We now know the mayor will make an announcement, rather than a decision, about
								Liveable Streets at the cabinet meeting on 28 September, and we’ll be watching
								closely to see what he says. We would expect him to talk about the results of
								the consultation and share more information about his timetable.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can’t be sure what the announcement will be, but we now have some time to
								move on to the other parts of our petition, starting with step 2:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								2. We ask the council to LISTEN to residents, businesses, schools and service
								providers across our diverse community to understand the benefits of the new
								street layouts, as well as any issues.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								A thorough debate at the 5 October full council meeting will be a good start, so
								that all our elected representatives can share their views. It is thanks to
								everyone’s efforts that there are enough signatures on the petition to trigger
								the debate.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are preparing our plans for the 5 October meeting of the full Council and we
								look forward to the discussion and debate that follows. We hope that the council
								meeting is the beginning of an ongoing dialogue with the council which could
								culminate in step 3 of our petition:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								3. We want to find ways to IMPROVE, not hastily remove the new street layouts.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								We have always said we would much rather work with the council, stakeholders and
								the whole community to come up with ways to improve what we have, rather than
								challenge any unlawful decision through the courts.
							</p>
							<p class="w3-large w3-text-black">
								<b>THERE’S PLENTY MORE TO DO – SO STAY IN TOUCH</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								We would like to thank everyone who is contributing to this campaign. Stay
								posted with what’s happening over on
								<a href="https://twitter.com/SaveOldBGR">Twitter</a> and
								<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sossbethnalgreen/">Instagram</a> – and please
								do keep pointing people towards the petition (open until 25 Sept) and the
								<a href="https://i.heartbg.uk/crowdjustice-web">CrowdJustice page</a> if they
								want to show their support for keeping and improving, rather than removing, the
								new street layouts in Tower Hamlets.

								The changes the council is proposing are in the name of helping car owners. Yet
								car owners do not make up the majority of those living in Tower Hamlets.
							</p>
							<p>
								Less than a third of households have a car in the borough. This is the lowest
								proportion of car ownership per household across London. And this proportion is
								falling faster than in other parts of London. There has been an 18% decline in
								the decade since 2010.

								This isn't a good situation: more cars, even more people, and all in the same

								<em>Almost £2million pounds has been spent on improving the streets in Bethnal

							<p>
								The introduction of traffic calming, green spaces, and seating areas, designed
								to reduce traffic and pollution in Bethnal Green, has cost £1.834 million of
								Tower Hamlets Council's money (this doesn't include any project-wide costs spent
								across the borough). Almost all this amount comes from capital funding that the
								council get from developers for community infrastructure projects (for a
								breakdown of figures, see freedom of information request Ref.

							<p>
								This council money, that belongs to everyone who lives in Tower Hamlets, is
								meant to be used on permanent projects designed to improve our borough - new
								streets, housing and the like. If the improvements in Bethnal Green are removed,
								the council and residents won't get the money back; it will be wasted. It will
								also cost more money to put things back the way they were.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's not remove the improvements to our streets and waste this money! We want
								Tower Hamlets Council to consult with residents, businesses and schools to see
								what can be done to further improve our roads for all.

								<a href="https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.23568" target="_blank">academic article</a>
								(Goodman, Laverty, Thomas & Aldred 2021) shows that fire engine response times
								are not being adversely effected by <em>Low Traffic Neighbourhoods</em> (LTNs).
							</p>
							<p>
								The article - by academics from Westminster, Imperial and the School of Hygiene
								and Tropical Medicine - presents a study of fire engine response times in and
								around LTNs in London. The work focuses specifically on LTNs introduced in 2020
								including in our borough, Tower Hamlets. The findings from the research show
								that there is no evidence to suggest LTNs have increased overall response times.
								This result applies in central, inner and outer London and whether the LTN uses
								physical or camera enforced restrictions. Notably, the proportion of delayed
								'first engines' fell across all areas after the introduction of LTNs. In
								addition, reported delays 'due to traffic calming' were "more than offset" by a
								fall in delays from traffic or roadworks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Research like this raises lots of questions for us in Tower Hamlets. It's still
								very early to know how low traffic neighbourhoods are impacting the emergency
								services in our borough but it's clear we really need to have free access to
								data, better understand the challenges and think collectively about ways
								forward.

								<strong>SAVE OUR SAFER STREETS</strong> believe the only way we can stop the
								reversal of the new green spaces and safer streets is to work together.
							</p>
							<p>
								We need to build a common voice to show we care about the high levels of
								pollution in Bethnal Green. Collectively, we need to take action to improve
								safety and the environment for all. What's really important is that this common
								voice is made up of as many people as possible from across the neighbourhood. We
								need to show Tower Hamlets Council that a significant majority of people want to
								build on the improvements that have been made to our streets.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that what we need is more experimentation with our streets; we need
								to allow our communities to find new ways to reduce pollution and to increase
								the number of green spaces where we can walk, talk and play.

								One of the first things to be aware of is that despite what many people are
								saying, the Tower Hamlets council do not have a mandate for reversing the new
								green spaces and safer streets. The new mayor and some new councillors from the
								Aspire Party did pledge to institute the reversal in the May local elections.
								However, the votes were not a full endorsement of this pledge. The Aspire party
								only won 36.95% of the total vote. Labour won 36.53% and the Green Party 9%, and
								both these parties supported Liveable Streets. It's also worth noting that only
								41.84% of the borough voted in the elections.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's clear that there's a lot to fight for and that many people will want a say
								on our new green spaces and safer streets.
